h2. About

*Note: This is Art19's fork of the url_validation gem.  Our fork contains the fix for validating
URL's that have spaces and tabs in them.*

This gem adds a very simple URL format validator to be used with ActiveRecord
models in Rails 3.0. It supports localized error messages. It can validate many
different kinds of URLs, including HTTP and HTTPS. It supports advanced
validation features like sending @HEAD@ requests to URLS to verify that they are
valid endpoints.

h2. Installation

Add the gem to your project's @Gemfile@:

<pre><code>
gem 'url_validation'
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

This gem is an @EachValidator@, and thus is used with the @validates@ method:

<pre><code>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :terms_of_service_link,
            :presence => true,
            :url => true
end
</code></pre>

There are other options to fine-tune your validation; see the {UrlValidator}
class for more, and for a list of error message localization keys.
